# WEb testing automation using Selenium Standalone Server JAVA API
This is a project where i have automated a function for generating a particular webpage/details of a particulkar seearched id, that we input in this java porgram
Selenium Standalone Server 4.1.0 is used
*No usage of Selenium Client*
The code has comment lines to explain about the process.

**Since the website was not properly made as per the general html standards of propern layout of a webpage, that's why a lot of "xpath" is used to identify certain elements of this page and then transfer control to the Selenium Web API to automate the whole process.
